## Project 3: Vulnerabilities Report

Frequent vulnerability and risk assessment operations are critical in understanding the potential risk of the information security infrastructure within an organization. Vulnerability assessment can identify potential problems and weaknesses in an environment that, combined with a threat, can be a significant risk to the organization's data integrity and continuity.
We imagine, you are a security analyst working in the Information Security department.

**Task:** Complete a vulnerability assessment according to your organizationâ€™s Vulnerable Assessment standards using a provided report template.
