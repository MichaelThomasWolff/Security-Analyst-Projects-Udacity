## Project 2: Insecure Juice Shop

Udajuicer is the largest juice shop in the world. They’ve amassed millions with shops all around the world, without a reliance on technology.
The internal business team came up with an online application where customers can place orders for delivery/pickup. The project was settled on a newbie, who created an insecure application.

Udajuicer proceeded to test the application out in beta for a week before production. Unfortunately, the site would constantly go down and they weren’t sure what the issue was. Wanting to get to the bottom of the issue he reached out to SecureCorp, the world-renown cybersecurity consulting firm. SecureCorp deploys you, a security analyst, to get to the bottom of the issue and find out why the Juice Shop site keeps going down. Your job will consist of building a threat model for Manu’s website. Using the internal threat model template provided you will go through the process of helping Manu mitigate his current issue and build a secure application.

Tools used in this projec:

* Oracle VM VirtualBox
* Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool. You can learn more about this tool here.
* OWASP Threat Dragon. You can learn more about this tool here.
* A generic drawing platform like draw.io.
