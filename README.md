## Project 2: Insecure Juice Shop

Udajuicer is the largest juice shop in the world. They’ve amassed millions with shops all around the world, without a reliance on technology.
The internal business team came up with an online application where customers can place orders for delivery/pickup. The project was settled on a newbie, who created an insecure application.

Udajuicer proceeded to test the application out in beta for a week before production. Unfortunately, the site would constantly go down and they weren’t sure what the issue was. Wanting to get to the bottom of the issue he reached out to SecureCorp, the world-renown cybersecurity consulting firm. SecureCorp deploys you, a security analyst, to get to the bottom of the issue and find out why the Juice Shop site keeps going down. Your job will consist of building a threat model for Manu’s website. Using the internal threat model template provided you will go through the process of helping Manu mitigate his current issue and build a secure application.

Tools used in this project:

* Oracle VM VirtualBox
* Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool
* OWASP Threat Dragon
* Draw.io

# Project 3: Insecure Web Application
The first request is an architecture diagram of the application and logs from right before the application went down. At a quick glance you we notice that the architecture is designed woefully. 
Part 1: Asset Inventory
The first part of our threat model is being able to identify all the assets involved in the target of the assessment.
Part 2: Architecture Audit
Now that we’ve identified all the components that makeup Udajuicer, let’s conduct an architecture review with the given diagram. Referencing what we went over secure architecture best practices, list out at least 3 flaws.
Part 3: Threat Model
Build a Threat Model Diagram showing the flow of data using OWASP Threat Dragon. 
Part 4: Threat Analysis
We’ve now identified a few insecurities in Udajuicer’s architecture and want to use this knowledge to help us identify what was causing the website to crash. Analyze the log file on the desktop to identify what type of attack took down the Juice Shop.
Part 5: Threat Actor Analysis
The final part of our assessment consists of us trying to identify who are possible threat actors.

## Section 2: Vulnerability Analysis
You’ve made it past the initial assessment and still have your sanity as working with Manu can be exhausting. You’ve identified the initial attack and shortcomings of the application setup. 


# Project 4: Intrusion Detection System

Analyse alerts in the Intrusion Detection System, set up SIEM to collect and analyse date, monitor systems for suspicious activity, document evidence and follow the incident handling procedure to respond to any issues you uncover.

Tasks include:
1. Analyse Alerts from the Intrusion Detection System using Sguil
2. Live Packet Capture 
3. Read and analyse Packet Capture
4. Create Snort rules
5. Use Splunk to Collect and Analyse Data
6. Use the Incident Response Playbook to Determine the Next Steps
