# Project 3: Vulnerabilities Report

Your task is to complete a vulnerability assessment according to your organization’s Vulnerable Assessment standards using a provided report template. Your report will be consumed by leadership of the Development Team, as well as practitioners. 

Your organization has a report template that standardizes all vulnerability assessment and analysis, which is available here.

Your vulnerability report must contain the following sections:

* Report Title/Cover Page
* Table of Contents
* Engagement Overview
1. Discussion of who requested the assessment and what the initial request was.
2. Discussion of appropriate assessment scope.
* Scope
1. Given the information provided by the Development Team, determine the appropriate scope of the vulnerability assessment.
2. Explain how the scope was determined.
3. If necessary, explain any considerations of the project that are considered out-of-scope and why.
* Risk Analysis
1. Provide a high-level risk assessment of the overall assessed risk. Provide an explanation of why this risk-level was reported. (High | Medium | Low)
2. In Layman’s terms, explain what vulnerabilities caused the overall rated risk.
* Recommendation
1. Provide general guidance for the Development Team to correct, mitigate, or resolve the assessed highest risk vulnerabilities.
* Vulnerability Summary
1. Provide a list of the significant assessed vulnerabilities listed in order of descending risk.
* Vulnerability Detail

For each significant assessed vulnerability, provide additional information.
1. Include the vulnerability name (and CVE if applicable).
2. Include an explanation of how the vulnerability was identified and validated.
3. Include an explanation of the vulnerabilities' probability of exploit.
4. Include a short proof-of-validation of the vulnerability (typically a screenshot or log excerpt, etc.).
* Analysis Methodology
1. The methodology section should be a scientific methodology that would allow another analyst to replay your actions to arrive at the same conclusions about the overall risk.
2. Include how the application was initially accessed and include a validation the defined scope is appropriate for the assessment.
3. Include a list of tools that will be used during the vulnerability assessment.
4. Explain in logical (usually chronological) order the actions that were taken to perform the vulnerability assessment.
5. Include screenshots of the vulnerability assessment process, tools, and actions made during the vulnerability validation.
