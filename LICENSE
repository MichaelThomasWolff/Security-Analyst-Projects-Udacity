Project License

I worked on these projects as a part of Udacity Security Analyst Nanodegree. Please remember that when you enroll for Udacity Courses you accept the Udacity Honor Code and below are 2 of the several terms you agree to:

1. You will not cheat on any assignment, projects, or assessments, as applicable, for the Online Courses. For example, giving or receiving unpermitted aid on, or copying or sharing of, another User’s (as defined in the Terms of Use) projects or other class work (or any portion thereof);

2. You will not plagiarize (a form of cheating) the work of others. For example, using another person’s original work (e.g., code, language, formulas, etc.) in your assignments, projects, or assessments.

If you are using solutions from this repository for project submission you are violating the above terms and you take full responsibilities of it. This repo is to refer to my project experience and not to use it for any submission on Udacity.

I, Michael Wolff the author of this repository, am in no way responsible if you get expelled from the course violating the Udacity Honor Code.
